Reviewability means that our application’s results are can be assessed and judged by our user’s experts, or experts they trust.\n  Reproducibility means that we are providing data products and tools that allow the exact duplication of our results during assessments. This makes sure that all logical steps can be verified. Reproducibility ensures that there is no lock-in to our applications. You can always chose a different data and software vendor, or compare our results with them.\n  We are creating applications that are confirmable and auditable. These are usually required by the ethical guidelines and professional standards of our users.\n  Confirmability means that using our applications findings leads to the same professional results as other available software and information. Our data products use the open-source statistical programming language R. We provide details about our algorithms and methodology to confirm our results in SPSS or Stata or sometimes even in Excel.\n  Auditability means that our data and software is archived in a way that external auditors can later review, reproduce and confirm our findings. This is a stricter form of data retention that most organizations apply, because we do not only archive results step-by-step but all computational steps – as if your colleagues would not only save every step in Excel but also their keystrokes. While auditability is a requirement in accounting, but we are extending this approach to all the quantiative work of a professional organization in an advisory or consulting capacity.\n  Because our data applications are confirmable and auditable, they are the best suited to meet the internal or external regulatory compliance of organizations, for example, reporting to external regulators or supervisory boards.\nSome of our data products are very complex and require extremely specialized knowledge. If your organization does not understand the boundary changes of European statistical regions or you do not have experts who are both familiar with government accounts and matrix algebra, you would not be able to review, reproduce, confirm and audit our regional products or economic impact assessments.\nIn these cases, we adhere to the strictest form of reproducibility, opening our software and data created by our software to the professional and scientific public. This means that we make specialized elements of our data applications available as open-source software and its replicable findings as open data. This ensures that anyone in the world may confirm and audit our findings. We believe that opening our code and our data to competitors and everybody else may increase competition, but it also increases the security of our software and provides the necessary trust for our applications in these cases.\nWhat is reproducible research? Reproducible research is a scientific concept that can be applied to a wide range of professional designations, for example, reproducible finance in the investment process or reproducible impact assessment in policy consulting. Based on the computational reproducibility [ref] we provide tools for consultants and analysts that fulfil the following principles\n  Reviewable findings: The descriptions of the methods can be independently assessed, and the results judged credible. In our view, this is a fundamental requirement for all professional applications.\n  Replicable findings: We are presenting our findings and provide tools so that our users or auditors or external authorities can duplicate our results.\n  Confirmable findings: The main conclusions of the research can be attained independently without our software, because we describe in detail the algorithms and and methodology in supplementary materials. We believe that other organizations, analysts, statisticians must come to the same findings with their own methods and software. This avoid lock-in and allows independent cross-examination.\n  Auditable findings: Sufficient records (including data and software) have been archived so that the research can be defended later if necessary or differences between independent confirmations resolved. The archive might be private, as with traditional laboratory notebooks.\n  These computational requirements require a data workflow that relies on further principles.\n  Record retention: all aspects of reproducibility require a high level of standardized documentation. The standardization of documentation requires the use of standardized metadata, metadata structures, taxonomies, vocabularies.\n  Best available information / data universe: the quality of the findings, their confirmation and auditing success will improve with better data and facts used.\n  Data validations: The quality of the findings will greatly depend on the factual inputs. While the reproducible findings may have many problems, inputting erroneous data or faulty information will likely lead to wrong conclusions, and in all cases will make confirmation and auditing impossible. Especially when organizations use large and heterogenous data sources, even small errors, such as erroneous currency translations or accidental misuse of decimals, units can cause results that will not pass confirmation or auditing.\n  Not only scientists, but many professional designations, like lawyers or CFA charterholders must make their findings, recommendations to be auditable. Management and policy consultants always work with new challenges and continuously expand their available fact and data universe. Satellite Report helps them with reproducible research tools to make these processes fast, low-cost, error-free, well-documented and archived.\nOpen or Reproducible Research is auditable research made openly available. We make some of our critical data procedures open, by publishing both our software code as open-source software and data created by our software as open data to invite peer-review challenges. We make our know-how open to collaboration when we use know-how that is scarce and internal validation is not possible – for example, when working with a highly structured national accounts products or difficult regional data boundaries.\n","date":1594368000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1594368000,"objectID":"8b4c6098bc453839b676310f7f8d2fdb","permalink":"/reproducible/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T10:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/reproducible/","section":"reproducible","summary":"We produce reproducible analytics tools.\nOur data analytics applications are reviewable and reproducible, which allows independent assessment and duplication of our results.

In popular music performers usually play their own composition and sing their own lyrics. If the musician is self-published, all the three royalties directly pay the artist’s work. If a professional publisher is helping the artist as a composer, or a record producer as a recorded performer, they usually share the respective royalty revenues. In emerging markets fewer, in mature markets more composers are represented by publishers and performers by record labels.\nClassification of Industries The nature of the creative jobs is that they contain a wide range of activities. Economists and government policymakers classify industries with the Nomenclature statistique des activités économiques dans la Communauté européenne, in short, with the NACE classification in Europe. This classification is largely harmonized on UN level and can be used to compare almost all economies in the world. The NACE classification has its origins in the economic structure of the middle 20th century, and it is more appropriate for the classification of manufacturing and trading activities, such as car manufacturing, or retail sale of cars.\nThe music industry is not even recognized by the NACE classification. For example, musicians often perform music (NACE group 90), compose music (NACE group 90), and at the same time do sound recordings (NACE group 58) and teach music (NACE group 85). Many EU member states do not even create government economic statistics for the NACE 90 classes.\nThis is the main reason why music is not well represented in governmental statistics, which is mainly based on tax returns data from ‘clear’ activity groups, such as sound recordings only. Most creative enterprises, and music businesses are no excemptions, do not have a clear economic activity.\nMicroenterprises \u0026amp; Freelancers The music industry, for various reasons, is not part of the NACE industry, and music industry data must be mapped from different data sources. A further difficulty is that music industry, similarly to the other creative and cultural industries, mainly works in freelancer networks and microenterprises. All over Europe, microenterprises are exempted from many statistical reporting, and they are filing simplified tax and financial reports.\nThe government statistics are largely based on tax returns and other filings of corporate entities with at least 5 employees. While most manufacturing or trading activities, or licensed service activities such as insurance or banking, are easy to classify, the creative industries are different. Because most creative enterprises are smaller than 5 people, they do not file many data for the government or the tax authorities, and they often carry out heterogeneous activities. For example, the music industry is not even recognized by the NACE classification – the live music and compositions can be found in the NACE 90 class, and the sound recordings in the NACE 58 class, and many countries do not even create government economic statistics for the NACE 90 classes.\nStandardized mapping CEEMID has been mapping data sources for composer, producer and performer royalties, and other data sources since 2014, based on the standard mapping technique developed originally in the United States and later adopted to the EU ^[Hull, Geoffrey P., Thomas W.

Some collective management organizations provided us with anonymous payout lists, which was essential to validate the representativeness of our samples. We reconstructed the density function of actual payouts, and collected data until our anonymous responses showed a very accurately similar shape.\nBecause the music industry all over Europe is mainly made of microenterprise and freelancers, getting an overal picture of the music industry is very difficult.\n","date":1594368000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594368000,"objectID":"a197a76508e47f44fcb9bb798fc2b528","permalink":"/reproducible/data_maps/","publishdate":"2020-07-10T10:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/reproducible/data_maps/","section":"reproducible","summary":"The copyright and neighboring right royalty is the wage-like earning of the music performer, the composer and producer.

In policymaking or in social sciences, it is a common practice to compare national statistics, which can be hugely misleading. The United States of America, the Federal Republic of Germany, Slovakia and Luxembourg are all countries, but they differ vastly in size and social homogeneity. Comparing Slovakia and Luxembourg to the federal states or even regions within Germany, or the states of Germany and the United States can provide more adequate insights. Statistically, the similarity of the aggregation level and high number of observations can allow more precise control of model parameters and errors.\nThe advantages of switching from a national level of the analysis to a sub-national level comes with a huge price in data processing, validation and imputation. The package Regions aims to help this process.\nThis package is an offspring of the eurostat package on rOpenGov. It started as a tool to validate and re-code regional Eurostat statistics, but it aims to be a general solution for all sub-national statistics. It will be developed parallel with other rOpenGov packages.\nSub-national Statistics Have Many Challenges   Frequent boundary changes: as opposed to national boundaries, the territorial units, typologies are often change, and this makes the validation and recoding of observation necessary across time. For example, in the European Union, sub-national typologies change about every three years and you have to make sure that you compare the right French region in time, or, if you can make the time-wise comparison at all.\n  Hierarchical aggregation and special imputation: missingness is very frequent in sub-national statistics, because they are created with a serious time-lag compared to national ones, and because they are often not back-casted after boundary changes. You cannot use standard imputation algorithms because the observations are not similarly aggregated or averaged. Often, the information is seemingly missing, and it is present with an obsolete typology code.\n  Package functionality  Generic vocabulary translation and joining functions for geographically coded data Keeping track of the boundary changes within the European Union between 1999-2021 Vocabulary translation and joining functions for standardized European Union statistics Vocabulary translation for the ISO-3166-2 based Google data and the European Union Imputation functions from higher aggregation hierarchy levels to lower ones, for example from NUTS1 to NUTS2 or from ISO-3166-1 to ISO-3166-2 (impute down) Imputation functions from lower hierarchy levels to higher ones (impute up) Aggregation function from lower hierarchy levels to higher ones, for example from NUTS3 to NUTS1 or from ISO-3166-2 to ISO-3166-1 (aggregate; under development) Disaggregation functions from higher hierarchy levels to lower ones, again, for example from NUTS1 to NUTS2 or from ISO-3166-1 to ISO-3166-2 (disaggregate; under development)  Vignettes / Articles   Working With Regional, Sub-National Statistical Products  Validating Your Typology  Recoding And Relabelling  The Typology Of The Google Mobility Reports (COVID-19)  Feedback?

First, we have used our open source software to correct the regional boundary changes during the decade (see Programatic Approach To Work With European Regional Data Panels).\nWhen data was missing in the end of the dataset, we used the last observation carry forward, when in the beginning, the next observation carry backwards data. Gaps in the data were interpolated using linear interpolation. Whenever data was available on a larger (provincial level), we imputed it to the smaller regional units.\nThe data contains standard national / regional references according the European NUTS2013 standard for backwards compatibility.

We’re all hoping for new information about the progress against the coronavirus. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these charts is meaningless. In fact, coronavirus case counts are meaningless, unless they are done with very heavy statistical knowledge, and even then they are very messy. Countries have different testing and hospitalization protocols, death certificating standards, and there are less and more trustworthy governments. We do not really know the severity of the local epidemics and the relative success of public health policies.\n    Nevertheless, we have some timely information on how people and the economy react to the epidemic, because there are ongoing, frequent, and comparable data sources on various consequences of the epidemic. A particularly interesting big data source is Google’s geolocational reporting on how people’s time spent in homes, workplaces, parks, shopping areas and recreational areas change. Google gets plenty of realtime data from hundreds of millions of people and compares them by days in the week and local time with the ‘baseline’ scenario before the outbreak of the coronavirus.\nBased on the locational data of various smartphones and application data, we know that people spend 10-15% more time at home since January, and 40-50% less in their workplaces. Similar data is available for other locations.\nWhile people are spending less time in the workplace and more at home in every European country, there are significant differences. Countries in the top left corner, most notable Sweden, switched less from workplaces to homes. On the bottom right corner, Spain and Italy, which were most hit by the epidemic, are in the most severe form of lockdown.\nThere are some outliers, like Romania, where people stay a lot more at home, but not so much less in the workplaces – probably they cannot afford to stay clear of the job, but they are reducing other activities. Or, in the case of Germany, people spend a lot more time in parks.\nI grouped the countries according to their dynamics. Looking at Belgium and Luxembourg, we see that they are more locked down than the typical European country, but they are moving up in the first week of April compared to the last week of March. This is very much in line with their improving strain on the health system.\nWhat is worrying is that there appears to be a significant asynchronicity in the Schengen zone, where people and goods should move around freely. The peripheric countries, which are less densely populated, often less integrated into the global transport and travel routes, are getting into the local epidemics later, and are acting later. This is logical from a national point of view, but given that the European economy is very much integrated, it will prolong the pain. The Netherlands, France and Germany need plenty of seasonal agricultural workers from the Southeast, where the lockdown is just getting really strict. While some of their regions see improving national epidemic situations, the easing will increase the intensity of the local epidemic if a large number of workers will arrive from countries that are just going into the epidemic.\nThe efficient solution, as many public health officials keep saying, would be a synchronized effort to contain the virus. The different pace and strictness of social distancing measures will mean that the local epidemics will not be in synchronization, and the countries will re-infect each other, this way prolonging the economic and social cost of this devastating pandemic. While health policy is a national competence in the European Union, in fact, the European economic and social life is so much integrated, not only within the Schengen Zone, but even with future, prospective and candidate members states in the Balkans, that a far more coordinated public health policy would be required.\nUse this in your article?

Since 2003 the EU and its members states have theoretically opened these vast data resources for the re-use of the market sector when there are no privacy or national security concerns present.\nRight after the opening of these data assets, it was estimated that the value of re-used public sector data, for example geographical, company registry, court, transport infrastructure data is around 25-47 billion euros. In the last 15 years, there have been signficant new investments into data assets, and futher innovation on using data.\nIn many cases, the re-usable public data offers a consistent and cheap alternative to private data collection, for example, pan-European surveying.\nAdvantages of PSI   There are vast data assets available for marginal cost, or for free, in size and value that could not be profitably financed by the private sector.\n  Re-use of taxpayer funded research increases the value for tax money, and avoids unnecessary duplication of data investments.\n  It is not possible to collect past data in the present. Public sources, however, often contain hidden data going back for 10-20 years or even more.\n  Difficulties of PSI   Re-usable data was created for a different purpose. While the data may be of high quality, it is likely not to be processed in the form the re-user wants to see it.\n  The data is often not documented, or not documented for the purpose of re-use.\n  The data is often difficult to find. It is technically re-usable, but even its existence is unknown for most business users.\n  The direct data costs of PSI are usually low - users only have to pay marginal costs, or sometimes they are not charged for a fair use of the data. However, the data processing costs are significant, because the data was not prepared for the business users needs. The data processing requires a special understanding of statistical standards and public data. This is one of our specialities - besides having a very detailed \u0026lsquo;treasure map\u0026rsquo; of European PSI. We are creating thousands of high-quality, pan-European business and policy indicators from open data sources.\nLegal Background In the EU, open data is governed by the Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information - in short: Open Data Directive (EU) 2019/1024. It entered into force on 16 July 2019. It replaces the Public Sector Information Directive, also known as the ‘PSI Directive’ which dated from 2003 and was subsequently amended in 2013.

This gave birth to CEEMID, originally the Central \u0026amp; Eastern European Music Industry Databases, a data integration programme that now in 2020, covers all of Europe. CEEMID fulfils similar roles to the planned European Music Observatory and supports all pillars of the future pan-European system.\nThe comparison of Western and Eastern music audiences reveals key demographic differences that make the unchanged adoption of business practices from mature markets in the region questionable. Chapter 2 of this report will show these differences and their consequences on music markets, in terms of visiting and acquisition likelihood, frequency, seasonality and purchasing capacity. This is an example of how CEEMID fulfils the role of Pillar 3 (music, society and citizenship) in the planned European Music Observatory.\n Chapter 3 contrasts market demand with the supply strategies of musicians. CEEMID has been surveying music professionals, including artists, technicians and managers about their working conditions, market conditions and plans for five years across a growing number of countries. In 2019 we invited 100 national and regional stakeholders to distribute our surveys. In some countries, our surveys already have several years of historic data, making the resulting musician database probably the largest ever source of data about how music is produced and how musicians live. We are constantly looking for partners to roll out this survey to new countries in new languages.\nThe CEE region has comparative advantages in big music events like festivals, and it has become one of the most important hubs for cultural tourism in the world. We explain this phenomenon in Chapter 4 by showing the differences in demand composition, demography and supply of venues in the second chapter. The lack of a modern and dense network of permanent music venues gave rise to magnificent music festivals in the CEE. Open’er, Sziget and Exit are among the biggest and best festivals in the world, closely followed by several smaller festivals in all countries. The share of festivals in the live music market is many times higher than in Western Europe and they provide vital export revenues to the local music economies. However, they play a limited role in finding new audiences for local artists, as they are increasingly programming for Western audiences by providing shows of international hits. They can only very partially fill in the gaps left by the small venue problem that hit the emerging markets harder than the UK or Australia, where policy action had been already taken to reverse the decline of the availability of smaller live music venues.\nOn the recording side, our analysis shows that modern digital services are growing at a faster rate than in mature markets. Because of lower repertoire competition, streaming quantities are similar for a typical Austrian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish or Slovak track than in the mature markets. However, revenue growth is limited because of the interplay of several analysed factors. Our analysis of the live and recorded music markets shows that CEEMID fulfils the roles of the Pillar 1 (music economy) of the planned European Music Observatory.\nMost recorded music sales revenue in the region comes from streaming platforms, just like in the mature markets. Successful sales strategies require a solid knowledge of the global marketplace and the ability to understand and train sales algorithms. Micro-enterprises, such as independent labels, have very limited ability to cope with these functions, given that they do not have market research or R\u0026amp;D functions. CEEMID and Consolidated Independent have started initiating open, national R\u0026amp;D consortia to create the necessary concentration in data assets, analytical capacity and budgets to close this gap. As a first step, CEEMID and Consolidated Independent have created a large, independent music dataset based on hundreds of millions of royalty statement entries to create our market indexes, styled after stock market and bond market indexes. Streaming opportunities are fast changing as roll-out of streaming services is happening at a different rate in various territories; subscription charges and the exchange rate to the producer’s currency vary and repertoire competition emerges in the market. Our volume and revenue indexes in Chapter 5.3 are aimed at creating sales algorithms that optimize sales volumes and expected revenues. We believe that this analysis also reveals that CEEMID partially fulfils the roles of Pillar 2 (music diversity and circulation) and feeds important data into Pillar 4 (innovation).\nThe region has far bigger untapped potential than most music business executives believe. Households in the region spend a significantly lower share of their recreational budget on music than their Western, Southern or Nordic peers. The region has a lot of untapped cultural purchasing power because servicing is particularly challenging in both the live and recorded sides of the business.\nThis upside potential cannot be tapped without better pricing. Royalty levels are often very low in the region. Due to many combined effects analysed in this short report, the gap between royalties earned in the CEE and Western Europe is several times bigger than the difference in GDP or national average wage. These gaps are partly caused by special interests preventing collective management from charging appropriate tariffs for restaurants, media companies or electronic appliance importers and manufacturers, and partly by unfavourable taxation of cultural products and services.\nCEEMID was designed to create economic evidence on royalty pricing, private copying compensation and the creation of economic value added in the industry. In the first Hungarian Music Industry Report of ProArt and in the first Slovak Music Industry Report we have shown that economic and taxation policies of the CEE countries aimed to support car and electronics manufacturing create a distorted, unfavourable economic regime for creative industries. We want to help local stakeholders with economic evidence to correct these discriminatory policies during the overhaul of the EU VAT system. We have been helping various national organizations with economic evidence, presented in the light of latest EU jurisprudence, to improve their pricing activities. Our thousands of indicators were also used in ex ante evaluations of granting schemes.\nIn 2020, all EU member states will change their copyright administration legislation because of the national implementations of the 2019/790 Digital Single Market directive. CEEMID provides evidence in several countries about the size and impact mechanism of the value transfer, and generally the widespread use of the copyright exemption for private copying. We believe that the thousands of pan-European music industry indicators that we have aggregated over the five years will play a vital role in these regulatory processes.\nCEEMID fulfils its roles with a very thorough exploitation of the EU’s 17-years-old Open Data regime with the re-use of public sector information, and a very careful mapping of the music industry. These maps help us conduct annual surveys among musicians and the audience, and they help us connect (always with pre-approval and with a user mandate) to industry databases. We do not only cover the EU countries, but increasingly (potential) candidate countries and neighbourhood countries.\nIn our vision, this data collection and integration, i.e. Pillars 1-3 should be available for all music stakeholders, should remain public and publicly funded. The last Pillar of the observatory, innovation, is where private entities should compete. The founders of CEEMID and Consolidated Independent believe that this report demonstrates the business and policy benefits of such a system with the analysis of the Central \u0026amp; Eastern European music markets. We believe that this way CEEMID is in a position to serve most of the planned functions of the envisioned European Music Observatory, and we are looking for ways to make either our thousands of indicators, or our data collection and integration software open source and available for all stakeholders in the EU and its neighbours. CEEMID was born out of necessity to level out the different levels of public research and statistical coverage of the EU member states. In our view, private entities in the future should focus their investments in Pillar 4 of the planned observatory, i.e. competing in innovation with creating new models, algorithms and services based on data that is available throughout the European Union without giving further advantage to the already mature markets.\n","date":1580310000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580310000,"objectID":"5ee96ab1e81941d29fc0164f71dc9a4b","permalink":"/publication/ceereport_2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-29T16:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ceereport_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The results of the first Hungarian, Slovak, Croatian and Czech music industry reports are compared with Armenian, Austrian, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, Serbian and Slovenian data and findings.","tags":["market-report","music-industry","Armenia","Austria","Bulgaria","Czechia","Lithuania","Hungary","Slovakia","Serbia"],"title":"Central \u0026 Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I have been involved since 2003 in the creation of official and non-official statistics and in the re-use of public sector information.

CEEMID has created thousands of high-value, hard music industry indicators using open data sources, industry data sources, surveys and various APIs to relevant other data sources. (More on ceemid.eu website.)\n  CEEMID is aiming to transfer thousands of indicators and a verifiable, open-source software that creates them to the European Music Observatory to give Europe-wide acces timely, reliable, actionable statistics and indicators for the music industry, policymakers and music professionals. (Read more about our data coverage)\nSatellite Report is aiming to support this transition, and at the same time, create new data products for other creative industries. See our call for partners.\nOpen source, open data, open collaboration We believe that the European Music Observatory must rely on open-source statistical software written in the R statistical language like CEEMID. (Read why.)\nIn the EU, open data is governed by the Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information - in short: Open Data Directive (EU) 2019 / 1024. It entered into force on 16 July 2019. It replaces the Public Sector Information Directive, also known as the ‘PSI Directive’ which dated from 2003 and was subsequently amended in 2013. The founder of CEEMID, Daniel Antal has been involved in Open Data and PSI since 2008.\nCEEMID uses the open source statistical programming language R, and various open source R programs. CEEMID also releases some of its customary program code developed to create its indicators (See open data on this site). This allows an open collaboration with statisticians working in national statistics authorities and in independent research institutions in the EU and globally. For example, this allowed us to compare test results on calculating economic impact indicators for the creative industries and other industries with the UK statistical office.\nThe use of open source software and the open source R statistical language allows a continuous peer-review of data ingestion, processing, corrections and indicator creation by statisticians, data scientists and academics. Statistical products of national statistical offices, sometimes Eurostat itself, not to mention data providers that are not part of the system of national statistical offices, such as the European Audiovisual Observatory, are plagued with data errors that are corrected and amended relatively slowly.\nData integration instead of centralisation From the originally envisioned, centralized, permission-based data structure, due to practical considerations, CEEMID switched to a more flexible, decentralized approach. This approach is based on continuous data integration, which requires permissions to use business confidential information only in use. This allowed a rapid extension of CEEMID to the whole of Europe and go even beyond. As a result of continous data integration it already includes hundreds of indicators foreseen in all pillars of the planned European Music Observatory.\nWhile CEEMID is aware of and uses the metadata of CISAC\u0026rsquo;s, IFPI\u0026rsquo;s, EAO\u0026rsquo;s, and other industry sources\u0026rsquo; data, it does not contain this data, only when a user with permission for the use of these industry sources requires the integration of such data with other CEEMID data, or user-specific data. While this approach makes sharing results more cumbersome, it provided a path to increase the number of useful indicators from a few dozens to around a thousand. Furthermore, it exponentially increases the value of CISAC\u0026rsquo;s, IFPI\u0026rsquo;s or EAO\u0026rsquo;s data, especially when designing better royalty rates, or creating economic evidence for litigation.
