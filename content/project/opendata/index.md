I have been involved in various OpenData projects since 2007, shortly after the introduction of the groundbreaking [Re-Use of Public Sector Information Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32003L0098) (last year replaced with the new [Open Data Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1561563110433&uri=CELEX:32019L1024)) of the Euroepan Union. (A brief history of this important EU policy can be found [here](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/european-legislation-reuse-public-sector-information) and its importance [(pdf)](https://www.europeandataportal.eu/sites/default/files/re-using_open_data.pdf).)
