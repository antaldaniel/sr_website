## Apps

We create applications that implement data collection, reporting and data analysis task in a reproducible manner. These applications are automatically documenting each step of these processes, and they are under constant supervision by data scientists. This makes sure that your team will always use the latest, well-processed, error-free data.

## Reproducible Data Retrieval

In many consulting companies and think tanks, junior staff is downloading statistical data, reports, and other external information for later use. We believe that this approach is wasteful, error-prone, and creates huge unnecessary workload during the analysis and the supervision of the work.

Analysts usually spend at least 80% of their work with data processing steps: pulling information out from spreadsheets and resources, and try to match them. Data arriving even from respectable institutions such as the Eurostat or industry organizations need a lot of adjustment for unit of measure, regional boundary changes, decimal places, and various identifier abbreviations. These steps cannot be reproduced in a file-based, spreadsheet workflow, and they create a major bottleneck in senior staff supervision.

Our applications put the data from various sources into tidy formats (a statistical definition of well-formatted data that can easily be joined with other data tables), making sure that suitable unit and currency translations took place, the missing values are professionally interpolated, forecasted or backcasted, and the latest data revisions are available.  We provide a one-point entry of well-formatted data for further use in your team's favorite spreadsheet or statistical applications like Excel, OpenOffice, SPSS or Stata.

## Reproducible modelling

We provide applications that are able to run thousands, or even tens of thousands of model combinations for pre-selection. The best model candidates are available with pre-processed data (without outliers, missing values when needed and valid performance metrics.)

## Reproducible dashboards

Our apps can integrate your internal financial or transactional data with thousands of external indicators from official statistics to satellite sensory data.  We make sure that your organization always has valid KPIs that are aware of the changes of your working environment.
